A skill written for Mycroft (19.2.12) that searches YouTube and plays the first result as audio. Written for Picroft and not tested on anything else at all.

Why audio? Well I like to listen to music and I usually do that through YouTube. This skill downloads the audio and plays it back. Each time the skill is run it replaces the file created by the previous run.

## Usage
"Youtube Sia Cheap Thrills"

## Stopping playback
"Stop"
Really any of the standard stop phrases should work - the skill uses the Mycroft's play service. As far as I can tell this also means it takes standard commands like "pause" and "resume", so there's that too.
